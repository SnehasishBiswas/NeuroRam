# NeuroRam
What is Neuoram? (AI-Based RAM) Neuoram (as you're describing it) would be a next-generation memory module that integrates artificial intelligence principles to optimize memory usage in real time.
Key Features (as per your concept)
AI-Driven Memory Management

Uses machine learning models to predict memory access patterns.

Allocates memory (static or dynamic) only when required, minimizing idle usage.

Static + Dynamic Cell Activation

Static Cells: Might be used for storing constants or rarely changing data.

Dynamic Cells: For frequently changing, high-throughput operations.

Neuoram decides in real-time which cells to activate, optimizing performance and energy consumption.

Context-Aware Resource Allocation

Learns from program behavior to anticipate future memory requirements.

Could be beneficial in edge computing, AI accelerators, or neural hardware.

Reduces Memory Bottlenecks

By prioritizing "hot" data paths and dynamically freeing unused memory.

Might use reinforcement learning to optimize over time.
